ðŸ“Œ Indian Screen Time Analysis â€“ Python (Jupyter Notebook)
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

Conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Indian smartphone usage dataset to understand digital consumption patterns, screen habits, and lifestyle impacts.

The goal was to extract behavioral insights that could assist in digital well-being studies, policy-making, and user engagement research for tech companies.

ðŸ”¹ Technical Implementation

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Imported dataset into Jupyter Notebook.

Performed data cleaning (removal of duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistent data types).

Normalized features like screen time hours for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Applied statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand central tendencies of screen time.

Used grouping and aggregation techniques to compare screen time across age groups, gender, and professional categories.

Conducted correlation analysis between age and daily screen time.

Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

Histograms & KDE plots â†’ to observe distribution of daily screen hours.

Scatter plots & regression lines â†’ to analyze correlation between age and screen time.

Bar & pie charts â†’ to compare screen time averages across categories such as gender and professions.

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights & Findings

Demographics & Usage

Younger age groups (18â€“30 years) reported the highest average daily screen time, often exceeding 5â€“6 hours per day.

Middle-aged groups showed balanced usage, while older demographics had lower engagement.

Gender-based Insights

Slight differences in screen usage across genders, with certain categories (like social media) showing higher female engagement, and others (gaming, OTT content) more male-dominated.

Behavioral Patterns

Students and professionals in IT-related fields showed above-average screen usage, indicating possible links to both work requirements and leisure activities.

A positive correlation was found between screen time and reduced offline activity, raising digital wellness concerns.

Screen Time vs Lifestyle Impact

Higher daily screen time was associated with reduced physical activity and disturbed sleep patterns (inferred from survey-based variables in the dataset).

Suggested the possibility of digital addiction tendencies in younger demographics.

ðŸ”¹ Business & Research Value

Provides actionable insights for:

Tech companies â†’ to understand user engagement and target digital products.

Policy makers & wellness advocates â†’ to promote balanced digital habits.

Researchers â†’ for studying digital well-being and lifestyle impacts in India.
